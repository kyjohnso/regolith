# Regolith - Lunar Simulation Engine TODO

## Project Overview
Building a game/simulation engine using Rust and Bevy 0.16.1 that allows players to move around a realistic lunar surface and interact with regolith spheroids. The goal is to explore the remnants of a moon-wide compute farm and use regolith to rebuild, adapt, and evolve it.
