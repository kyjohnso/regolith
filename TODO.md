# Regolith - Lunar Simulation Engine TODO

## Project Overview
Building a game/simulation engine using Rust and Bevy 0.16.1 that allows players to move around a realistic lunar surface and interact with regolith spheroids. The goal is to explore the remnants of a moon-wide compute farm and use regolith to rebuild, adapt, and evolve it.

**Technical Goals:**
- Explore limits of Bevy ECS
- Implement GPU-based physics for regolith simulation
- Target 1M+ particles with real-time physics at 30fps minimum
- Create sandbox for lunar computation exploration
